RuntimeError: adaptive_avg_pool2d_backward_cuda does not have a deterministic implementation, but you set 'torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)'. You can turn off determinism just for this operation, or you can use the 'warn_only=True' option, if that's acceptable for your application. You can also file an issue at https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues to help us prioritize adding deterministic support for this operation.
